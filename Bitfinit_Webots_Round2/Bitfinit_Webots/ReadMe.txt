Round 2 

Final round of the competition using Webots simulator. We were tasked with designing two robots that can:

Follow a white line through a maze
Detect and carry colored boxes (red, green, blue)
Stack the boxes in a specific order at starting squares
Communicate with each other.

There were various restrictions and rules, including:

Robot size and speed limits
Sensor and actuator limitations
Box dimensions and weight
Navigation rules (e.g., staying on white surfaces)
Communication methods
Time limit and cost restrictions

The robots will be judged on various criteria, including:

Time to complete the task
Movement accuracy and smoothness
Robot design realism
Navigation techniques and algorithms
Cost efficiency

Here our team utilized A* algorithm to map the maze and traverse through it efficiently.

No importing cad models are required , the robot is build front transform nodes

only robot_a has a controller and only it will move , robot_b will not move

The cad design provided is not needed to simulate the robot in webots
