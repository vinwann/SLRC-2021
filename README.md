# SLRC-2021
The University Category competition of SLRC  2021 provided a valuable platform for the innovative youth to learn, experiment, and grow in the field of robotics. 
Due to unavoidable safety concerns, the competition was conducted on a fully virtual platform which presented additional challenges and innovations.

There were 2 stages in the competition, where competitors had to score through tasks of each stage and climb up the leaderboard to secure the win in the final round.

Stage 1 - Remotely Coding a Physical Robot
Here competitors were tasked to remotely program a robot made by the organizing committee.
Hardware specifications, models, and other necessary information were provided through a task document.
The team was not allowed to interact with the robot during the programming phase.
A testing round was provided for calibration and fine-tuning.
The following capabilities were tested during the first stage of the competition.
Straight Line Following,
90-degree turns,
Color detection,
Distance measurement,
Obstacle avoiding,
Displaying messages on the screen

Stage 2 - Simulation of a robot
Teams were given a predefined task and sample material for a robot simulation.
The task required to demonstrate the following functionalities.
Straight line following,
Curved Line following,
Tree traversal,
Color detection,
Communication between robots,
Pushing an object,
Dashed line following,
Ramp Navigation

For the final build, the display for the image processing was hidden yet under the hood the above processing was carried. No libraries were used the algorithm targets the last 4 rows of the image to find the white line. Then it would process the location of the line wrt to the robot
